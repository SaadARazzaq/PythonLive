**Have you ever wanted to add more details to an already running code?**

Instead of stopping the code, you can use the **"reloading" library**. 🔄

This allows you to add more details to a running code without losing any existing progress. 📈

## Overview 📝

This Python code demonstrates how to modify a function during runtime using the "reloading" library. It enables you to enhance the functionality of your code without stopping its execution. 🐍

## Getting Started 🛠️

- Before you get started, make sure you have the "reloading" library installed. You can install it using pip: ⚙️

```bash
pip install reloading
```

- Run the `test.py` file
